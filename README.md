# Yarn Spinner for Godot C#

This plugin is an implementation of the [Yarn Spinner](https://yarnspinner.dev/) tool for writing game dialogue sequences. If you aren't familiar with Yarn Spinner, you can learn more about it by checking out their [documenation](https://docs.yarnspinner.dev/).

This plugin uses C# exclusively. If you are writing your game in GDScript, consider using the awesome [GDYarn plugin](https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/747) instead of this one.

The scripts included in this plugin are based on Yarn Spinner's own [Unity package](https://github.com/YarnSpinnerTool/YarnSpinner-Unity), but there are some important differences. Those are noted in the [wiki](https://github.com/tjmclain/YarnSpinner-GodotSharp/wiki/Getting-Started).

If you encounter an issue, please report it to the [Github page for this project](https://github.com/tjmclain/YarnSpinner-GodotSharp).

For more information about this plugin and best practices for its use, please refer to the [project wiki](https://github.com/tjmclain/YarnSpinner-GodotSharp/wiki/Getting-Started).
